# Guess the Number Game 🎲

Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! 🚀

This simple Python console game allows you to challenge yourself in guessing a random number within a specified range. You'll have a maximum of three chances to guess the correct number. Good luck, and let's get started! 🍀

## How to Play 🎮

1. You will be asked to enter the minimum and maximum values that define the range for the random number. 📈

3. You have up to three chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback, letting you know if your guess was too high or too low. 🔍

4. If you guess the correct number within three attempts, you win the game! 🎉

5. If you use all three chances and haven't guessed the number, the game will reveal the correct number. 🙈

6. You can choose to play the game again or exit. 🔄
